Overview

This project involves creating a personal website about myself. The aim was to develop a multi-page website, showcasing abilities in HTML, CSS, SCSS, and responsive web design using Bootstrap 4. Each webpage is interconnected through navigation links, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Project Structure

index.html - The home page of the website. This page uses a Bootstrap grid layout to organize content and includes a navigation bar for site navigation. It also makes use of Bootstrap's carousel component to display some images related to my interests.
about.html - Provides some more information about me. This page demonstrates the use of Bootstrap grid layout for content organization.
gallery.html - A gallery showcasing images related to my interests and activities. Bootstrap's image thumbnail component is used here for a neat and responsive layout.
contact.html - A contact page with a form for visitors to leave messages. It demonstrates the use of Bootstrap's form components.

Stylesheet

styles.scss - The SCSS file that compiles into CSS for styling the website. It includes a variety of CSS properties and selectors, a mobile-responsive media query, and demonstrates the use of SCSS features such as variables, nesting, and inheritance.

Key Features

Bootstrap 4: Utilized for responsive layout and styled components like navigation bars, cards, and forms.
SCSS: Enhanced CSS with variables, nesting, and inheritance for more efficient styling.
Responsive Design: The website is responsive, adjusting layout and content for optimal viewing on various devices and screen sizes.
